I am Rahul Seetharaman, an (incoming) MS CS student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Previously, I worked at Microsoft Research India as a Software Engineer, in the Systems group, under Dr Muthian Sivathanu. 
I am very interested in Natural Language Processing, and on the lookout for research opportunities in the same.
